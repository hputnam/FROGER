# FROGER - Functional Re-annotation of Oyster Genomes with Epigenetic Resources
Funded by USDA NRSP-8 Aquaculture small project grant 

#### Date: May 20 - 23
#### Location: [URI Alton Jones Campus Whispering Pines](https://web.uri.edu/wpinescc/)

## Goals

1. Annotating Epigenetic features in the Eastern Oyster Genome (EOG)

	* DNA methylation
	* Chromatin associated proteins
	* Transposable Elements
	* CpG poor rich regions
	* miRNA
	* lncRNA
	
2. Comparison of DNA methylation quantification methods in the EOG
	* WGBS - Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing
	* MBD-BS - Methyl Binding Domain enrichment followed by bisulfite sequencing
	* MSAP - Methylation Sensitive Amplification Polymorphism 

### Projected Products 

1. Annotation for EOG and gap analysis for improved epigenetics annotation approaches

2. Manuscript on methods comparison for DNA methylation data - target: Frontiers in Marine Science [Special Issue: Marine Environmental Epigenetics](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/9475/marine-environmental-epigenetics#overview)
