As part of a larger analysis of population structure and associations with the environment, we've looked at (1) CpG O/E differences 
among populations and (2) associations between CpG O/E and environmental variables.

1) A Kruskal Wallis test for CpGO/E (of a gene or exon or whatever feature) ~ Population. This tells us if CpGO/E differences among 
populations are significant (but note that this does not correct for population structure).
* We also calculated the CV in CpGO/E among individuals, which represents overall variation at that locus

The code is here:

And outputs are here:

2) We used lfmm_ridge to calculate the association between CpGO/E and the available environmental variables (based on Kevin's code). 
We also calculated Spearman's rho.
